# Crime and Punishment

**_Crime is clearly a major social problem_** and by and large the way most societies deal with it is through some form of official punishment, involving imposing fines, confining people in prisons and even executing people. This chapter explores ethical debates about crime and punishment, concerning such questions as...

:::{.question data-latex="" .infobox}

- What is the justification for punishing people who commit crimes in general?
- What particular forms of punishment, and what particular rationales for punishment are ethically defensible?
- Is the death penalty a legitimate form of punishment?

:::

Now it might seem ridiculous to ask that punishment for crime be given a general justification. It seems obvious to most people that committing crime, wronging or hurting others deserves and requires punishment and that the only question is that of the degree of punishment. And yet philosophers start to get suspicious whenever anyone claims that something is completely obvious. Maybe we just like making life difficult, or maybe there are some unquestioned assumptions that need to be clarified and supported if we are going to be able to resolve pressing difficulties in our policies on crime and punishment. The fact that there are difficulties is itself painfully obvious as the following points show:

- The United States currently has the world's highest per capita prison population: the number of people incarcerated in federal, state and local jails exceeds 2 million.
- Crime rates nevertheless remain high as do rates of recidivism or return to jail after release for other convictions.
- More types of behavior are considered criminal in the US than in most other countries around the world (the exceptions are fundamentalist Islamic countries and dictatorships).
- The US is the only Western democracy to utilize the death penalty in peacetime. 
- The death penalty continues to attract controversy, especially concerning the possibility of executions of innocent people. 
- Police continue to be granted more power to arrest, prosecute, seize property, as the official "get tough on crime" policy adopted all around the country continues its popularity among politicians and the general public.

**_If we are to define crime_** in a non-circular way (we can't simply say that crime is what our society deems to be illegal because that is a circular definition) we can perhaps say that crime is the deliberate infliction of pain and suffering on other people by taking from them things that are theirs, harming them physically or mentally or taking away their lives or their liberty. If we consider the punishments that we give out for committing crimes in the light of this definition of crime, however, a problem appears. We punish people by taking away their property (fines), by making them work without compensation (community service), by taking away their liberty (jail), or by killing them (execution). But how are these any different than the crimes of theft, forced labor, kidnapping or murder? Is it just because state officials carry them out? We can thus see why it is that punishment requires justification -- because if it lacks justification then we can't really distinguish between the kinds of things that count as crime and the kinds of things that would count as a legitimate social response to crime. If punishment lacks justification then the only difference between crime and punishment would be the identity of the person or people carrying it out -- it's called crime when it's done by anyone other than the official representatives of the state.

**_The state,_** that is, the set of official governmental institutions that wields power, has a monopoly on the use of violence or the use of force. This gives the state an enormous power over its citizens. The state can take money from individuals (taxes and fines), take away freedom (restraining orders and jails), kill (the death penalty). So the task of justifying punishment is that of showing why the state should have such power, how such power should be wielded, in whose interests that power is wielded, and what exactly the state should be allowed to do. Many opponents of the death penalty, for example, argue that whatever other powers the state has (taxation, punitive fines and imprisonment) it should not have the power to kill its own citizens. This might be argued because it is too socially risky to allow the state to kill, or it may be argued on the grounds that there are some things that the state is just not allowed to do, if it is to be a legitimate state. On the other hand, backers of the death penalty often insist that the state has the right to do whatever is necessary to maintain order within its borders, including kill troublesome offenders. Clearly power is a major issue here.

**_Because crime and punishment_** look quite similar to each other, and because a state that can arrest, fine, confine and even kill its citizens has enormous amounts of power over its citizens, punishment requires justification. So then how might punishment be justified? Our answer to this question will have far-reaching consequences -- it will determine the nature of acceptable punishment, the function of punishment and the limitations on punishment that we endorse. Since justification of punishment will involve distinguishing justified from unjustified punishments this is the same as establishing limits to punishment. Different types of justification will respect different limits. 

**_In general,_** there are two approaches to justifying punishment, those that focus on the social good done by punishment and those that emphasize the idea of justice. These are known, respectively, as utilitarian and retributivist theories of punishment. As we will see, even though our society appears to endorse both of these approaches to punishment, they are deeply in conflict with each other.

## Utilitarian approaches 

**_Utilitarian approaches_** to punishment typically focus on the good that punishment can do. Thus they tend to be forward-looking. Punishment itself is the deliberate harming of someone and this is wrong for utilitarians unless it is a way of attaining a greater good for all involved. There are three different views that are all broadly utilitarian in their approach to crime and punishment:

1. Isolation theory: the criminal is enough of a threat to society to warrant confining him or her to prevent more harm from being done.
2. Deterrence theory: crime should be prevented by harshly punishing those convicted for crimes -- this will make non-criminals think twice about whether to commit crimes or not.
3. Correction theory: crime is a sign of a maladjusted character that needs to be coercively readjusted to fit in better with society. Punishment is one important tool in readjusting criminals to society.


### Isolation {-}

**_The first of the utilitarian approaches_** to punishment is based on the idea that punishment, imprisonment or even execution, is primarily a way of removing certain people from circulation in the public world. This can be justified, on this view, if isolation of the prisoner costs less, both monetarily as well as in terms of pain and suffering to all affected, including the prisoner, than the benefit enjoyed by society as a result. So if my being stuck in a jail cell causes everyone else to sleep better at night knowing that I will not be climbing through their windows looking for valuables to steal, and reduces the costs of my criminal activities in other ways that outweigh the costs of imprisoning me, it may be justified to imprison me. I say here that it may be justified because, if the price of keeping me in jail is high enough, or people's desire to sleep well weak enough, it may not be justified. But in spite of these complications about the exact consequences of confining me, the basic idea should be clear -- justification for punishment is to be sought in its ability to make the world a better place for those on the outside of prison walls. This approach to punishment clearly requires us to be able to predict whether or not imprisonment of offenders will lead to a greater good or not, and this may be difficult to determine. Are all of the billions of dollars we spend on locking people away in jail well-spent billions, or are they an expensive relic of a past approach to crime in which people who committed crimes were assumed to possess an inherently criminal nature that would cause them to always commit further crimes? 

### Deterrence{-}

**_An alternative,_** and very popular attempt to justify punishment points to the possible deterrent value of punishment for other people besides the one being punished. The claim is that punishment is justified to the degree that it sends out a message to everyone else (especially people who may be thinking about committing crimes themselves) that crime does not in fact pay. If we see someone who committed a crime being punished we will think twice about violating the law ourselves. There are (at least) two issues that need to be addressed when considering this approach to crime -- whether it is effective crime control policy, and whether it is just. The first issue can only be settled by figuring out the degree to which people who commit crimes are in fact motivated by the expected results of their actions, as this view claims. Then we need to find out how different punishments have different deterrence results. Many advocates of the "get tough" approach to crime assume that a more severe punishment will have a higher deterrence value, that killing a murderer will prevent more murders than fining murderers \$50. This seems to make sense. Yet empirical studies of crime and punishment carried out both by advocates of and critics of deterrence theory have so far been unable to come up with any solid answers about whether or not there is any meaningful connection between severity of punishment and the crime rate. Perhaps the real world is just too complicated for this simple bit of armchair psychology to be of much use in determining the behavior of such complex creatures as ourselves. Whatever the case may be about the real effects of punishment on people thinking about committing crimes there is a deeper problem with deterrence theory. Since punishment is supposed to be effective to the degree that it sends out a loud and clear message it seems like it would be effective only if that message is "swift and sure" -- if the day after the bank is robbed someone is caught and thrown in jail. It's all a matter of making the connection between crime and punishment as clear as possible to everyone watching. But, unfortunately for this view, most criminals attempt to protect themselves from capture by committing crimes in ways that make it difficult if not impossible to get the person who did it.  Besides all of this, justice seems to demand that only the person who really committed the crime should be punished for it. All of this, however, adds up to delays in getting the message out, so it seems that on the utilitarian grounds we are here considering, the innocence or guilt of the individual punished is not that important. If punishment is justified by its effects on others, then sometimes framing an innocent person seems justified if there is no other way to effectively send out the massage that crime doesn't pay. This, of course, is the problem with utilitarianism in general once again -- if what is right is what leads to the greatest good for the whole of society, sometimes it seems acceptable to sacrifice innocent people for the good of all others.

### Correction{-}

**_The last utilitarian approach_** to punishment we will consider is the idea that punishment can be justified only to the degree that it serves to readjust criminals' behavior in socially more acceptable way, that it "corrects" people. At first glance it may seem strange that this view is grouped together with deterrence theory under the general heading of utilitarian approaches to punishment. This is because contemporary debate about crime policy is often framed in terms of the two opposing views of deterrence theory (a favorite of political conservatives) which demands a getting tough on crime and correction theory (a favorite of political liberals) which requires helping people to overcome their anti-social behavior in more cooperative and less punitive ways. But these two views share a number of features:

- Both look at the justification of punishment in terms of its results, lowered crime rates
- Both are willing to manipulate individuals to achieve this, by making them afraid to commit crimes, or by readjusting their behavior through job training and counseling as well as punishment
- Both insist on looking at the effectiveness of punishment rather than the issue of justice. That is, neither ever asks the question, are people getting what they deserve?

**_In spite of these similarities,_** there are clearly also differences that need to be taken into account here. If punishment is justified to the degree that it prevents people from repeating criminal acts, then it seems to make a difference whether or not the one being punished is the one who committed the crime. That is, if it ain't broke don't fix it -- if you did nothing wrong it is a waste of time to readjust your attitudes by sending you to jail to think about what you did wrong and convince you never to do it again. So the problem of punishing innocent people is not as bad here as it was for deterrence theory. Here an effective crime policy requires at least finding the person who committed a crime. 

## Retributivist approaches

**_In spite of the_** "kinder and gentler" approach of correction theory to punishment, Kant and other fans of deontological ethics, might raise the following questions about it:

- Does anyone have the right to tell other people how to live their own lives? 
- Isn't there something basically disrespectful about coercive attitude adjustment of the kind given out in prison?
- What about justice -- isn't punishment the kind of thing that some people deserve because of what they have done and not simply a means of making the world a better place than it was in the past? 

**_But what is justice?_** In the simplest of terms, justice involves individuals getting what they deserve or being treated fairly. In some contexts this would require not discriminating against people by giving them a lower pay or less opportunity for no good reason -- in such cases individuals do not get the benefits or opportunities that they deserve. These are cases where "distributive justice" is not being done in the sense that some people are unfairly excluded from equal consideration in society's distribution of benefits and opportunities.

**_There is another way,_** however, in which people may (or may not) get what they deserve. When someone intentionally and knowingly wrongs someone else, say by mugging them at gun-point, the person who has been wronged has not gotten what they deserve, respectful treatment by the person who has wronged them.  Further, if the person who did the mugging fails to be punished in some way even if they are caught by the cops, it may seem like they haven't gotten what they deserve -- punishment. Questions of this kind, about giving people what they deserve when they have knowingly and willingly wronged other people are sometimes known as questions of retributive justice since they have to do with retribution or pay-back for wrongs done.

**_One thing to notice_** about retributive justice is that it is essentially backward looking -- figuring out what someone deserves in retribution focuses only on what they have already done. This approach to punishment is very different from that of the utilitarians who were above all else concerned with the consequences -- in the future -- of punishment, the good that could come out of intentionally harming someone in punitive custody. 

**_There are three basic approaches_** to retributivism: simple retributivism, social contract theory and Kantian retributivism. We will consider them one at a time.

### Simple retributivism{-}

**_Simple retributivism_** is best captured in the famous biblical slogan, "An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth." The idea behind this approach to justifying punishment is to appeal to the notion of fair treatment. People should be treated the same way that they treat others. In spite of the appeal and the popularity of this approach to justifying punishment, however, it fails to provide any guidance whatsoever. First of all, taken literally it leads to nonsensical results -- how many people actually go around poking out others' eyes or stealing their teeth? Well you might respond that this is not intended to be taken literally, but instead expresses a general principle -- you should be payed back "in kind" for what you do that harms others. But then we may ask whether you can always be paid back in kind. For example, if you are a tax evader how could you be paid back in kind? Or if you speed excessively? Or shoot someone's dog, when you yourself are not a dog owner, etc. Second, and more seriously, it does no more than simply express a desire for justice without any explanation at all of why punishment is justified. Why is it important to pay people back in kind for what they do? It may seem obvious enough, but is that any kind of basis for a justifiable and rational approach to punishment, or does it just beg the question concerning the justification of punishment?

### Social contract theory{-}

**_One attempt to make up for_** the failure of simple retributivism to address the problem of justifying retribution is suggested by Social Contract Theory. We looked as Social Contract Theory earlier as an attempt to provide a foundation for ethical and social rules in general. Here it is more relevant as a theory of the origins and justification of political authority. It tries to root the authority and the legitimacy of political institutions in a real or fictitious agreement between citizens living under state authority. The relevant idea here is that society can be looked at as a kind of game -- there are certain rules of the game of living in and otherwise participating in society. Once these rules are established we would all be granted certain "rights, and privileges" while being expected to take on certain "responsibilities." If someone were to violate these established rules, then they would be required to sit out of the game for a while and if this violation of the rules was severe enough they completely lose the *right* to play the social game at all. We won't have too much to say about the social contract approach here, except to point out a few problems that render it unworkable as a theory of the justification of punishment. 

**_The first problem here_** concerns the rules of the game that we are supposed to have violated when we commit a crime. What exactly are these rules and why are they binding on each individual? Are they the laws that happen to be on the books at any particular moment? But these are subject to modification -- new laws are constantly being created and old laws are constantly being revoked. If the right to play the social game is based on the laws that happen to be around at any given moment and these laws change it seems like our basic rights can change depending on the legislative mood of a society. That seems to make rights a lot less solid than the usual talk about rights presumes.  

**_Second, and more importantly,_** if punishment is owed to someone for breaking the rules, then this seems to get things backwards -- do I really deserve punishment because I broke the rules, or are the rules what they are because that somehow reflects what our society deems to be worth protecting? What is the point of these rules? And finally, social contract theory makes rights relative to a set of social norms and claims that they are not absolute. But doesn't that undermine the very concept of rights? After all, if I insist that my rights are being violated, as did American blacks during the civil rights era, I am appealing to a concept that transcends the particular rules of society at the time. I am appealing to something universal that any particular society cannot take away, even if that society can fail to respect it. Thus if rights are the kind of things that particular societies can take away, they they are simply not rights.

### Kantian retributivism{-}

_**This discussion_** of the absolute character of rights seems to leave us in a bind. If rights are absolute then how on earth can we ever be justified in punishing anyone? After all, punishment involves the deliberate infliction of harm on someone and that patently seems to be a violation of rights. We seem to have a choice, either respect everyone's rights or punish some people. One philosopher, our old friend Kant, claims that this is a false dichotomy, that is, he tries to show how, if we properly understand the concept of responsibility, we will see that in those cases where people are responsible for treating others in a criminal manner, they both deserve punishment and continue to have rights. In fact, as paradoxical as it may sound, in Kant's view criminals are to be punished *because* they have rights and it would be a violation of the *criminal's* rights *not* to be punished. Seems strange perhaps. Let's see how it works.

**_Since punishment is,_** on the view we are currently considering, all about retributive justice, it is crucial that punishment only be given out to people who have actually done what they are accused of doing. Furthermore, if such people are to be punished they must also have been fully responsible for their actions. Thus, if someone gets killed accidentally, as a result of my car hitting them in circumstances that I had no control over (like, if someone trips and falls into the street as I happen to be passing) then the result is certainly tragic, but no one is truly responsible for the death of the victim, no wrong has been done. On the other hand if I deliberately run someone down with intent to kill them, and I succeed in doing so, then a wrong has been done and the death of the victim is something I am responsible for. In the real world it sometimes difficult to assess the exact degree of responsibility involved in cases where somebody gets hurt. This is why in criminal courts there are different punishments corresponding to different degrees of responsibility, in cases involving the death of another these range from first degree murder to negligent homicide and so on down to no responsibility at all in cases of accidental death involving no wrong. In spite of this practical difficulty in actually determining the degree of responsibility the theoretical point here is clear -- to wrong someone you've got to know what you are doing and do it intentionally.

**_So far so good._** But why does someone who intentionally harms another, who wrongs them, deserve punishment? According to Kant we all owe respect to others no matter what and this seems plainly incompatible with the claim that some people deserve to be locked up or even executed. The key to Kant's justification of punishment lies in his conception of autonomy. When we treat others with respect this means allowing them to make up their own minds about what is valuable to them, in the full expectation, of course, that they will also see that others deserve respect as well. There is a risk, however, in trusting someone like this, in allowing them to decide for themselves how they should behave. For example, someone may come up with the idea that you are not worthy of respect if you have something they want. The person who disrespects you after having come to this conclusion is failing to see that everyone is equally worthy of respect and that no one should be treated like a means to an end. Instead they are treating you as if you had merely instrumental value and so were not worthy of respect. In Kant's view we are all free to make decisions like this, but when we act on the idea that others are not worthy of our respect we are also announcing something to the world -- we are basically saying that in our view people are not worthy of respect, that they don't deserve treatment as ends in themselves but only as means to our ends. Let's look at an example.

**_Let's say that I decide_** to murder someone I do not like and so I deliberately plan a way to kill them and when I get the opportunity, I carry out the murder. If I actually do this I am assuming that it is OK to murder someone who I don't like. But notice what this means -- if I murder someone under the belief that it's OK for me to do so, am I not also assuming a more general point, that human life doesn't have the kind of value that would prevent me from ending someone's life when it was in my interests? Kant's answer is yes, that I am indeed assuming this simply by carrying out a deliberate and pre-planned murder. My action speaks louder than words, it announces to the rest of the world that I do not find human life valuable. Since this was my free and autonomous decision it follows that the only way for others to respect me is to treat me in the same way that I have decided that others should be treated. In the case of murder, since it is possible for me to murder someone only because I do not value human life, the only way for others to respect me, to act on my wishes would be to kill me as well. So, paradoxically, it is an act of respect to execute a murderer in Kant's view.

**_This may sound_** a bit strange, but Kant claims that if justice is giving people what they deserve and people deserve treatment according to the standards they themselves freely set, then it seems to follow that someone whose standards allow for the deliberate termination of others' lives can only be respected by being treated as they see fit to treat others. This idea is not only limited to cases of complete disrespect for others lives, but in cases of partial disrespect for others where someone deliberately harms others without actually killing them. In these cases punishment of a lesser degree, whatever fits with the degree of disrespect the criminal's actions demonstrate, is appropriate. 

**_There are a few points_** to bear emphasizing here:

1. Punishment is only acceptable when the person being punished is really guilty of willingly and knowingly harming another.
2. Punishment only serves the interests of justice, it is not legitimate as a way of maintaining order in society, or of correcting the offender coercively, by forcing them to act more responsibly. This is simply because these would both violate the autonomy of the person being punished.
3. Punishment must be proportional to the degree of disrespect exhibited in the act that is being punished.

**_We have seen_** that there are two major approaches to justifying punishment, the utilitarian and the retributivist approaches. Each of these approaches assumes something very different about our responsibility for our actions. Utilitarians assume that we are not really responsible for what we do and so have to be manipulated into behaving as we should. That is, we need to be scared into submission (deterrence theory), coercively made to want to behave (correction theory) or simply locked up because we cannot be convinced to behave (isolation theory). On the other hand, concern for retributive justice, a common thread in all of the retributivist theories, is based on the claim that we are really responsible for what we do in some cases and it is because of this that we deserve punishment. This is especially clear in Kantian retributivism -- it is because we are responsible adults making up our own minds about how others are to be treated that some of us deserve punishment. The difficult question I'd like to ask is this: how on earth can we be, at one and the same time, both responsible for our actions and not responsible for our actions? It seems impossible. But, aren't our society's policies concerning crime and punishment somehow based on *both* of the approaches we have been considering here? That is, we have departments of correction and put a lot of emphasis on the deterrent value of punishment, and yet we also insist loudly on the responsibility of people for their actions. But there is an inherent contradiction embedded in this approach, isn't there? How on earth can we have both?

## The Death Penalty

**_The death penalty_** has a long and complex history in the United States and continues to attract a great deal of controversy. Some people claim that it should be abolished, while others are firmly in favor of it and insist that it should be used much more frequently than it is. We certainly won't settle these debates here, but the death penalty is a great example for bringing into focus the various arguments about crime and punishment in general that we have been considering here. What I'd like to do in this section is talk about how the two basic theoretical justifications for punishment in general might address the topic of the death penalty. Then I'll develop an argument as to why, while it may be justified in principle there are some good reasons to be opposed to it in practice.  

### Utilitarian Arguments{-}

**_How might a utilitarian_** consider capital punishment? As we have seen in other cases utilitarianism doesn't really allow us to determine whether or not something is right or wrong *in principle* but instead requires us to ask about particular cases and find out whether one choice or another leads to a "greater good" than other available alternatives. This would seem to leave us in the difficult position of not being able to have any more general policy governing a punishment like the death penalty and to force us instead to decide each case individually. In other words, we'd seem to have to look at each particular criminal case and decide which possible punishment from among the available options would lead to the best overall outcome and then go with that one. But this doesn't really provide us with any guidance as to whether or not the death penalty should even be one of the available options. We can however, avoid this difficulty if we follow the lead of a version of utilitarianism which we have so far neglected to mention, "rule utilitarianism." "Rule utilitarianism" is an attempt to address what we might call the "information overload" problem that ordinary utilitarianism seems to face. The ordinary version of utilitarianism evaluates each individual act, one at a time, to determine whether or not it leads to the best outcomes among those of all of the available alternatives. But following this procedure for every decision we might make seems like it is beyond the capacity of mere mortals like us. So rule utilitarians basically say, well that kind of calculation of the outcomes of every decision we make is only a problem for "act utilitarianism," we can take a much more efficient approach and look at what *tends to happen* in similar kinds of cases and in that way can come up with general rules to guide our choices. Of course, *sometimes* what usually works out for the best just doesn't but if we are careful and decide what general moral rules we'll follow based on decent research in to what does in fact tend to happen, we are all set.

**_In the case of the death penalty,_** as long as we follow the lead of rule utilitarianism it does in fact seem that we can come up with a general account of the morality of capital punishment. *If* capital punishment tends to maximize utility overall, then it would be a justified punishment to keep available as an option in particular cases. If it does *not* tend to do so,  then we should abolish it. What this line of argument does is to turn the moral debate about capital punishment into a policy debate about whether capital punishment does sufficient good to compensate for the harms it causes. And it does cause harm. Remember that according to utilitarianism, *everyone* who is affected by the consequences of our actions counts, and in this case this certain includes the person who is executed. Considerations of justice and who deserves what are just not part of the utilitarian framework for moral decision making, so no matter how counterintutive it may seem to do so in cases on crime and punishment, in looking at the utilitarian approach to capital punishment we need to leave them out. 

**_Keeping these points in mind_** how do things stand for a utilitarian evaluation of the morality of capital punishment? The answer is that *if* we can show that in general capital punishment does more good than harm then it would warranted as at least an option in certain cases according to utilitarianism. Two ways of looking at this issue are often brought up in debates about capital punishment that are relevant here: the idea that capital punishment alone offers a sense of "closure" to victims and that it is thus justified, and the idea that capital punishment has a significant deterrence value which would offset the harms it does. Let us look at each of these points in turn.

**_The first utilitarian argument_** about capital punishment hinges on the idea that executing someone who has harmed people in a serious way can do certain things for victims that not executing them cannot. By "victims" here I mean not the immediate victims of a crime that has led to the seeking of the death penalty since typical capital cases are murders and the immediate victims are dead. I mean the "secondary" victims such as friends and family of the immediate victims. Thus the argument is often given that these secondary victims lack something, a sense that justice has been served, that the case has been closed, that the murderer will never strike again, and so on, as long as the murderer remains alive. If capital punishment can provide this sense of closure to these victims then it is legitimate, according to this argument, as long as this feeling outweighs the harms that capital punishment does. The presumption that proponents of this argument typically make is that it will in fact provide such feelings of relief to these secondary victims. Some in fact claim that it does, but then again some claim that it does not. It is, as we might imagine, very difficult to generalize for all cases of capital punishment. Sometimes the victim of a murder might happen to be someone who was well loved *and* their survivors might happen to feel a great sense of relief and the ability to "move on" after their killer is executed. Other victims might not have had much in the way of friends and family at all, or in case they do, their friends and families might just *not* feel any relief at all. It seems to me at least that resting the legitimacy of capital punishment on an attempt to generalize based on a "typical" case of murder and the effects of an execution on the people left behind is too fraught with difficulties to be workable.

**_Well what then about_** the second utilitarian argument about capital punishment, one that might appeal to the good that it might do by having a deterrent effect? Once again this is an argument that is contingent upon how things play out in the real world, since it is an argument about the real or likely consequences on a particular punishment on particular people. To see whether or not capital punishment does have any effect on murder rates would require extensive and careful analysis of data on crime and punishment. And it is not quite clear from this data whether or not particular punishments do in fact have much to do with decision making on the part of "would be" criminals in the future. One staunch proponent of the death penalty is the philosopher Ernest Van den Haag who has argued that if it could be shown that "some" potential murderers are deterred by the thought of the "ultimate" penalty this would make the death penalty "worth it."[@ErnestVanHaag] This strikes me as more of an appeal to common assumptions about what should happen rather than as a completely solid argument in favor of the death penalty. As even van den Haag himself admits, finding out what the actual deterrent value of the death penalty might be in the real world is probably impossible to do, simply because there are too many variables in play to determine whether one factor affecting decision making in potential situations where someone might kill someone else like the presence or absence of the death penalty might make a significant difference. Falling back on common assumptions about what *should* happen is not basis for a policy that is supposed to be based on empirical facts.

**_However things play out_** in terms of the real consequences of executing people for certain crimes, this is how a utilitarian might argue. As we have seen when we examined utilitarianism earlier, everything here depends on our ability to determine what the consequences of our actions actually are and this seems especially difficult to do for capital punishment since we are not here only talking about individual cases but of typical results of certain types of actions -- executing versus not executing convicted murderers. It is always difficult in such debates to separate the genuinely supported empirical facts of the matter from common sense understanding of what really *should* happen in these cases. But the burden of proof for utilitarians must lie on the factual side of things since their fundamental claim is that a certain policy really does have certain effects. If one argues this way, well then the facts on which one's argument is based should at least themselves be clear.


### Retributivist Arguments{-}

**_Well then what about the other_** basic approach to the justification of punishment, the retributivist appeal to what people deserve? How might it address the question of the death penalty? As we have seen in our discussions of retributivism, in spite of the intuitive appeal of simple retributivism, as captured in the slogan, "an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth," we'll need to show why death might be a warranted punishment for certain crimes and we will need a principled way of doing this rather than just appealing to a felt sense of what is right. After all if people's lives are in the balance we cannot just rely on our subjective sense of right and wrong but need something that might actually guide policy in a way consistent with broader social ideals of fairness that are central to life in a democratic society.

**_We have already seen_** the weakness of social contract theory when it comes to showing why it is that we are justified in punishing people in general and the same points apply in the case of the death penaty as well. Even if it may seem that it is possible and maybe even desirable to understand rights as the kinds of protections that might be forfeited in certain circumstances doing so leaves rights vulnerable to the arbitrary exercise of power. Who is it that would get to decide in what circumstances someone would forfeit their rights? Wouldn't this make rights dependant on something a little too shaky?
