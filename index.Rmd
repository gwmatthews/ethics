**_This book_** is an introduction to philosophical ethics intended for use in introductory college or high school level courses. It has grown out of lecture notes I shared with the first students who took my online Ethics course at the Pennsylvania College of Technology  almost 20 years ago. Since then it has seen more development in a variety of forms -- starting out as a pdf document, and then evolving into a static set of WordPress pages and finally now as a book written in bookdown and hosted at GitHub. This text represents my attempt to scratch a few itches. The first is my wanting a presentation of the major philosophical approaches to ethics that I can actually agree with and that is integrated into my overall teaching method. I tend to teach philosophy to beginners and so there is a fair amount of discussion of the tools used by philosophers and of the ways in which their approach differs from that of their colleagues in other disciplines. 

**_There are_** of course many good quality ethics textbooks out there, and yet none has exactly matched my way of wanting to present the material. Teaching ethics over the years has been a process of active exploration and constant revision of my approach as I have come to a more nuanced and richer appreciation of what ethical thinking and theorizing is all about, as well as some ideas about how I think the main strands of argument relate to each other. Yes this is a partisan effort, but it's all subject to revision and refinement based on, I hope at least, the better argument. That's what I am trying to get across here. 

**_The second itch_** I am trying to scratch here has to do with initiatives in open education, and I'd like this text to contribute in its own small way to the much larger and more influential open source movement and philosophy of which I consider it a part. Knowledge is only ours to share. Yes of course writers, developers and publishers do hard work that deserves compensation. But intellectual property, it seems to me, is a false idol that deserves to be smashed. So here is my effort to chip away at it -- knowledge should free us and and not sink us into both literal and figurative debt.

**_In addition_** the decision to convert this text into a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/gwmatthews/ethics) should be considered as an invitation for others to participate in its future development. Anyone can fork the repository where it resides and use it as a template for their own book project; offer suggestions for revisions, or contribute in other ways as well. Please use the "issues" section of the repository for making any major suggestions.

## Dedication {-}



```{block type='epigraph'}
Receive correctly this monk's word-stream, neither frozen nor trickling away, neither transparent nor muddy. When you wring it dry, take advantage of the opportunity; when you enter the bustle, perceive with your whole eye. Thorough understanding and the changing world fulfill each other totally without obstacle. The moon accompanies the current, the wind bends the grass...Find your seat, wear your robe, and go forward and see for yourself.

---Hongzhi, *Cultivating the Empty Field*

## Acknowledgements {-}

**_The writing_** and publication of this book would not have been possible without the work of numerous people who make and share their amazing work in the open source software community. It is based in particular on the work of [Yi Hui](https://github.com/yihui) and the other developers of [bookdown](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown) and [Rstudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) and related software. While it has been a bit of a steep learning curve figuring out how to use Rstudio and bookdown to write and style a book, it has been a lot of fun too! The end product, hopefully, speaks for itself and demonstrates that these tools are not just for people with highly technical backgrounds, but can be used by anyone with some computer skills and a bit of patience to create functional, cross-platform and pretty good looking web based books.

## How to use this book {-}

### Read it {-}

This should be self-explanatory, but be sure not to miss the icons on the top of the screen which enable you to:

- Open up and close the sidebar with the table of contents in it.
- Search within the text for a keyword.
- Change the color scheme or font to make it easier to read.
- Offer editorial suggestions on GitHub (see below for how this works).
- Download a pdf version of the text for offline reading or printing.
- Find out keyboard short cuts for navigation.

Also note the arrows on the side of the screen (or down at the bottom if you are reading on a small screen) that bring you to the next or previous pages.

### Comment on it {-}

If you are a current student in one of my Ethics classes you'll have to do some commenting. When I used WordPress to host this text that was a built in feature. Here I am relying on a third party commenting add-on to the online version of the book. There are many ways to do this, with Disqus being one of the most popular. I chose to use a system called [Remarkbox](https://www.remarkbox.com/) for the following reasons:

1. They do NOT track users. 
2. And so there is NO targeted advertising that you will be exposed to just by responding to a page in an online textbook, in fact there is no advertising at all.
3. It is an open source project that was created by someone as an alternative to other commenting systems like Disqus that DO track users and inundate them with ads.

To use this system you will have to enter a valid email address and then click on a link in the email this system sends you and then whatever comments you make will be stored on the Remarkbox servers. You can see exactly what they store by reading their [privacy policy](https://www.remarkbox.com/privacy-policy.html).

When you first use the system you will get a random bunch of characters as your user name. If you are a student in my classes please change this to the format Your-first-nameLast-initial: So John Smith would be JohnS and I am GeorgeM. That's just so I can keep track of who is commenting how much for grading purposes.

**How to comment**

1. Type your comment in the box at the bottom of the page -- you can format it using [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) or just write in plain text.
2. Enter a valid email address in the box below.
3. Click the "save message" button.
4. Go to your email inbox, open the message from Remarkbox and click on the link there.
5. You will be redirected back to the page you commented on and will now be logged in.
6. If this is your first comment, you can change your user name by clicking on the letter in a colored circle next to the "watch" button -- that will open up "user settings" where you can change your user name to something like SheenaE (if you happen to be Sheena Easton).
7. You can also log out, and either follow or unfollow any comment threads you like.
8. If you get stuck with your profile open, you can use the back button or your browser or refresh the page. (Seems like a bug to me, honestly, but this is software in active development.)

Others are also welcome to comment on the text. Please be respectful though or you might get banned.


### Contribute to it {-}

If you find a mistake, don't think it's clear in some part, have an issue with any part of it, want something more added, etc. I encourage you to contribute. You can do this in a couple of ways.

- Leave a comment and we can discuss possible changes.
- Click on the "edit" button on the top menu bar -- this will take you to the GitHub repository where the source material lives. There you can either open up an "issue" and we can discuss it there, or you can "fork" the repository make whatever edits you want and then offer them in the form of a "pull request." All of this assumes that you:
  + Know what "git" even is.^[If you don't, it is a version control system that enables collaboration and it mostly intended for software development, but it can be used for working together on any kind of project that involves electronic files, from novels to operating systems. If you want to learn more, check out [Happy Git and GitHub for the useR](https://happygitwithr.com/) or [Learn git with Bitbucket Cloud](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/learn-git-with-bitbucket-cloud). I love reading documentation, don't you?]
  + Have an account at GitHub -- which is free. And GitHub pages is a great way to get yourself a free website too!
- Send me an email if you know me in the real world.
