# Liberty and its Limits


**_As we have seen_** in a variety of contexts, one way of understanding ethics is as an attempt to justify certain restrictions on our freedom. In general freedom is a good thing. But then there are some things that we just shouldn't do. The most obvious things we shouldn't do are things that involve deliberately hurting others. For example we would think that a bus driver who deliberately ran his bus full of passengers off of the side of a cliff did something that he shouldn't have done. It also seems clear that he would be morally and legally responsible for hurting others if he were to get drunk before showing up for work as a bus driver since he would be endangering the lives of the passengers as well as of other people who happened to be driving on the road with him. In such cases we seem to have every right to restrict the driver's freedom to do things like this. But what if this same driver decides to risk his own life by driving alone across a vast road-less area of the Sahara desert without enough fuel in the bus? Or what if he decides to get drunk while driving alone across the uninhabited desert where no one besides himself could possibly get hurt? These two cases might be cases of just plain stupid behavior, but can we, or should we, be able to restrict his behavior simply on the grounds that he himself might get hurt? These kinds of questions are at the root of the current controversy about the use of illicit drugs. Depending on how we would answer them, we will either end up siding with one of two different positions: libertarianism or paternalism. Libertarianism is the view that we should have the maximum amount of individual liberty possible -- whatever we see fit to do, for whatever reasons, we should be permitted to do, as long as it harms nobody but ourselves. Paternalism, on the other hand, is the view that we need protection from ourselves and that there are others, such as experts, legislators and policy-makers, who know what is best for us, and should decide for us the limits of our individual liberty even in such cases where we are the only ones likely to get hurt.

**_One way to address_** these alternatives is in terms of a number of different principles for limiting liberty. These principles have been endorsed by various philosophers and political thinkers over the centuries.

- **The harm principle**: originally proposed by John Stuart Mill, this principle states that the only permissible limitations on liberty should be those that prevent us from directly harming others. Thus, although it would be wrong for me to practice my target shooting in a very crowded part of Boston, it would be acceptable for me to experiment with the injection of household chemicals into my veins according to the harm principle. Libertarians accept this view since it allows for the greatest amount of liberty.
- **The social harm principle**: a more restrictive principle that is based on the recognition that we can harm others in indirect ways through the impact of our actions on society as a whole. Thus it may be socially harmful, and so, according to this principle at least, wrong, to sell pornography to consenting adults if it were to be shown that the sale of pornography encourages domestic abuse on the part of the purchaser, even if in some particular cases there is no abuse.
- **The personal harm principle**: a yet more restrictive view that claims that it is wrong to use your liberty in ways that hurt oneself. Paternalists endorse this principle claiming that it is wrong to deliberately do things to oneself that it would be wrong to do to others.
- **The offense principle**: the most restrictive view, which claims that it is wrong to exercise one's liberty in ways that cause offense to others. For example, it would be wrong for a woman to wear skimpy clothes in public if the local population is sufficiently conservative, or wrong to use language in a manner that people within earshot would find offensive. In spite of the restrictive character of this last principle, it does not necessarily capture the view of paternalists since it makes no mention of harm to oneself as being inherently offensive to others. Extreme social conservatives might adopt this view.

## Libertarians and paternalists

**_Libertarianism_** is the view that claims that we have no right to prevent someone else from engaging in risky, dangerous or disgusting behavior as long as it is clear that no one else will be hurt by that behavior besides the person engaging in it. In other words, libertarians argue that the state has no right to prevent me from riding a motorcycle without a helmet, watching pornographic videos in the privacy of my own home, injecting myself with whatever substances I feel like, as long as no one else is hurt by what I do. Even if I do things that are patently stupid, and clearly go against my own best long term interests, it is up to me whether or not I do them.

**_The bottom_** line for libertarians is liberty. In their view liberty is what makes human life worth living, and it needs to be protected from arbitrary limitation. In the view of libertarians, unless it is clear that what I am doing infringes on your liberty or harms or sets back your interests, it should be up to me to decide what to do with my life. Libertarians defend this view by appeal to the benefits, both individual and social, of allowing as much liberty as possible. A society that allows as much liberty as possible may at times seem chaotic, but it is also a society in which individuals can find personal satisfaction in whatever way they see fit and in which society as a whole benefits from the innovations and new ideas that only free individuals can create. 

**_Paternalism_**, in contrast, is the view that it is acceptable to restrict others behavior even when what they are doing hurts only themselves. Paternalists believe that even mature adults need protection against our own impulses at times. 

**_Paternalists thus make the assumption_** that we are not always competent judges of our own interests. Left to our own devices we would degrade ourselves with drugs just for the sake of the cheap thrills they bring, we would gamble away our life savings in pursuit of the easy money of winning the jackpot, we would endanger our lives by taking stupid risks for the sake of the fleeting pleasure of riding a motorcycle with the wind in our hair. That is, paternalists are not confident that the average adult can in fact make rational, adult-like decisions about his
or her own life. Thus, they believe that strong social sanctions, like laws regulating intoxicating substances, gambling, prostitution, etc. can be good things. Even though such laws limit our liberty, without them both individuals and society as a whole would needlessly suffer from self-abuse and degradation.


## The Case of Recreational Drugs
 
**_The debate between these two perspectives_**, libertarianism and paternalism, underlies a particular question that many societies have been grappling with in recent decades, that of the legal status of certain intoxicating substances or "drugs." I this section we'll see how this debate plays out by examining a number of different arguments that have been brought forward either against legalizing the recreational use of drugs or in favor of it. As more and more states in the United States have legalized the recreational use of marijuana in recent years, these arguments have come into prominence and I am sure all of them will seem familiar.

### Against legalization {-}

**_There are a number of arguments_** that are typically given against the legalization of certain controlled substances that are currently prohibited for recreational use. I'll consider three of the most commonly given ones here. All three are often used to justify official federal policy in the USA and other countries as well and all have been challenged by states and countries that have recently legalized the recreational use of marijuana. 


::::{.center data-latex=""}
:::{.argument data-latex=""}

The use of drugs for recreational purposes is in itself wrong.\
In addition it has a corrupting effect on non-users when some people use drugs.\
One of the roles of law is promoting public and moral order.\

So currently illegal drugs should remain illegal.

:::
::::

**_This argument no doubt_** raises controversial points. Is the recreational use of drugs in itself wrong? If so, why exactly is it wrong? It would seem that utilitarianism would reject this idea, insofar as the recreational use of drugs might be pleasurable. A Kantian might perhaps see the recreational use of drugs as a violation of one's duty to oneself to live up to one's potential, but only if this use interferes with one's larger goals and aspirations. Certainly an occasional user need not undermine her life's projects by smoking or drinking every once in a while. So what moral theory does this claim then depend on? It seems like it might appeal to some conception of moral virtue, as developed by Natural Law Theory, since the use of drugs could be looked at a moral failing that indicates having a weak will or an inability to deal with life's problems and a willingness to seek an easy escape from those problems. But, as we saw in the earlier, Natural Law Theory faces some serious problems as an account of right and wrong. It grants too small a role to human freedom and choice in determining right and wrong and assumes that it makes sense to impose a single "template" of what morally correct action must look like on all of us. Hence this approach seems to many people to be suspect.

**_On the other hand_**, suppose it were true that the recreational use of drugs was inherently wrong from a moral perspective, what then? Does it follow that because it is wrong it should thus be illegal? It almost seems to be taken for granted in official policy making circles that this is the case. But is it? Is the role of the criminal law to police public morality? Is that were the case, why are some "vices" such as smoking tobacco, watching pornographic videos, and the consumption of alcohol tolerated and others, such as the use of drugs such as marijuana and cocaine forbidden? We will return to this question of consistency in more detail later. For now, we can just state as an objection to this first argument, that the fact of something being wrong from a moral perspective alone wouldn't necessarily be enough to warrant its being made illegal. We live in a society that takes individual liberty seriously and separates "private" moral concerns from "public" legal concerns. The next argument, however, considers in greater detail the issue of broader, more public social harm suggested by the second premise of this first argument.


**_Our next argument_** is similar to the previous one in that it assumes that the use of certain substances (so-called "hard drugs" -- basically anything more serious than marijuana) is either wrong or at least personally and also socially a very risky thing to do. But it also and argument that has been used against those who claim that marijuana is different than other drugs, since it is physically less harmful and generally less debilitating in its effects on the user, and so should be legalized.

::::{.center data-latex=""}
:::{.argument data-latex=""}

People who smoke marijuana at a young age are more likely than people who don't to use harder drugs later in life.\
If we legalize marijuana more people will smoke it at a younger age.\
So legalizing marijuana will increase the use of hard drugs.\
The use of hard drugs is wrong and/or poses great public risks.	\

So marijuana should not be legalized.

:::
::::

**_This argument_** is the familiar "gateway drug" argument. It is often simply assumed in debates about drug use that marijuana is in fact a "gateway drug," as in the familiar claim I saw recently in a video on the debate about drugs, "drug counselors consider marijuana to be a gateway drug." The issue here has to do with what exactly it means to be a "gateway drug." If it means that in fact people who use hard drugs like cocaine and heroin have most likely used marijuana prior to having used heroin or cocaine then it is obviously true that marijuana is a gateway drug. After all, most heroin users do not start out with injecting heroin into their veins. They probably started drinking alcohol and then moved on up the scale of more serious drugs that provide a more powerful effect. But this is not enough to get the argument off the ground, since what it needs is a relationship of cause and effect. It is because you use marijuana that you are much more likely to use other drugs later -- that is the claim that is being made in the argument. But is that true? Doesn't this look suspiciously like a case of the "false cause" fallacy? It is clearly true that marijuana users are more likely to use heroin that non-marijuana users, but that does not by itself mean that marijuana use *causes* heroin use. That would be like saying that because the sun arises shortly after my alarm clock goes off every day, then the clock's going off must cause the sun to rise. In fact, the causal relation between marijuana use and heroin use is undermined even more by a simple fact about usage rates. Even though large numbers of people have smoke marijuana on a regular basis, many fewer are regular heroin users. But if marijuana *caused* heroin use, shouldn't the numbers of heroin users be significantly higher? Compare the claim that smoking causes cancer -- if only one percent of smokers ended up with cancer, then this claim would clearly seem to be stretching the evidence. So then, how do we explain why non-marijuana users are far less likely to use heroin than marijuana users? It seems clear that there may be some common third factor that is the cause of both. Perhaps I have a physiological weakness for addictive substances, or come from a background that leads me to drug use in general. Whatever the case may be, whether it is nature or nurture that leads me astray, it would be this third factor that leads some people to smoke marijuana and some others to both smoke marijuana and use heroin. But this is not at all what the gateway argument claims and significantly weakens its attempt to show that marijuana is far too dangerous to be legalized.

**_Our next argument_** takes a more modest approach -- the approach of limiting harms to acceptable levels without trying to make unsupported claims about the unique features of certain currently illegal substances.

::::{.center data-latex=""}
:::{.argument data-latex=""}

The abuse of alcohol and tobacco are an enormous social problem -- they lead to huge public health costs, lead to lower productivity, and endanger others through the effects of second-hand smoke, DUI accidents and bad behavior under the influence.\
If drugs were legalized, this would add to the problems created by alcohol and tobacco.\

So currently illegal drugs should remain illegal.

:::
::::

**_This argument seems_** fair enough. The question, however, is why set up the boundary between illegal and illegal exactly where it currently happens to lie? Shouldn't we have some serious studies to back up our claims that drugs $a$ and $b$ should be allowed (alcohol and tobacco) but not drugs $c$ and $d$ (marijuana and cocaine) because that leads to the least possible harm? There is nothing in principle to prevent it from being the case that the legal drugs should be alcohol and marijuana, with tobacco being classed with heroin and cocaine as too risky to the public. But that seems contrary to the inherently conservative character of this argument. It seems to be saying, "We should avoid changing the current situation because adding new substances poses further risks." But then maybe the current situation needs to be re-addressed as well, if the idea is to minimize risks over all and not just defend the status quo.

### Consistency {-}

**_We must now,_** finally confront the issue of consistency. Alcohol and tobacco are risky in much the same way that illegal drugs are risky. So why then is it legal for adults to use them? The next argument, which addresses this issue of consistency, deserves consideration on its own, since it is neither strictly prohibitionist nor strictly against prohibition. It just demands like treatment for like harms and thus, depending on our assessment of the potential harms of the use of drugs may or may not support their legal prohibition. There is, however, a catch to this provocative argument -- if currently illegal drugs pose too much of a threat to be legalized, and alcohol and tobacco pose the same threat, then the latter should also be made illegal.

::::{.center data-latex=""}
:::{.argument data-latex=""}

Alcohol and tobacco are just as risky to individuals and society as currently illegal drugs are.\
So the same arguments should apply to both.\
Rational policy should be consistent.\

So currently illegal drugs should remain illegal if and only if alcohol and tobacco are made illegal.

:::
::::

**_This argument clearly rests_** on an appeal to the idea that we should have a single set of legal standards that apply across the board in cases that are relevantly similar. So the question that we must ask of supporters of this argument is: are currently illegal drugs really so similar in their personal and social effects to currently legal drugs? If the answer is yes, and there is a good reason to have a consistent social policy, this argument seems fairly strong. Note that it is not necessarily an argument for the legalization of drugs. It simply points out that our policies concerning alcohol and tobacco are inconsistent with our policies towards other drugs. If both are equally harmful then either both should be permitted or both should be forbidden. Failure to treat both the same amounts to irrational social policy. As a parallel example consider the recent legislation that permits motorcycles in the state of Pennsylvania to ride without helmets. This legislation was introduced at the same time that measures were enacted to stiffen penalties for not wearing set belts while driving. If adults are legally permitted to assume the added risk that comes from riding a motorcycle with out a helmet why then are we not allowed to assume the added risk of driving without a seat belt? Likewise, if our own safety is the motivation for the state to enforce seat-belt laws strictly, why then are not motorcycle riders compelled to wear an obvious enhancement to their own safety? Inconsistent social policy it seems has little defense.

### Against prohibition {-}

**_The first argument against_** prohibiting drug use by adults, takes us back to our earlier discussion of libertarianism. Libertarianism, we remember, is the view that adults should have the maximum possible amount of liberty. This argument, with suitable modifications, applies to many social issues. It has been successfully used to defend the wider legalization of gambling, a lack of restrictions on the access of adults to pornography, the legalization of prostitution,  not to mention revisions of motorcycle helmet laws.

::::{.center data-latex=""}
:::{.argument data-latex=""}

Liberty is an overriding good, so adults should have as much of it as possible.\
The only reason to restrict someone's liberty is to prevent them from directly harming others.\
It is possible to use drugs without directly harming others.\

So adults should be allowed to use drugs as they see fit.

:::
::::


**_If you found libertarianism_** at all compelling in our discussion above, you will no doubt find this argument plausible. The burden of proof certainly rests on the third premise. Is it truly possible to use drugs without directly harming others? According to the image of drug users in the media and in official policy presentations of the issue we may have reason to doubt this. In response, we may simply point out that alcohol, in spite of its powerful effect on human behavior, is allowed precisely because of the judgment that it can be used in such a way that others are not harmed. This certainly does not mean that it cannot be used in a way that puts others directly at risk. But those cases, such as DUI cases, for example, are severely punished and are not considered acceptable uses of alcohol. Once again, if we would like to be consistent and judge the liberty to drink alcohol as an important freedom, not be be restricted except in cases of overt and direct harm to others, why not then extend this liberty to other substances as well?

**_The final argument_** I'd like to present is one that has more, perhaps, to do with social policy than it has to do with purely logical and ethical considerations. This argument poses the question: is the War on Drugs, declared in the early 1970's by President Nixon, re-declared by Reagan in the 1980's, and Clinton in the 1990's and still the official approach to the problem of drug use, really worth it? Does it perform as advertised?

::::{.center data-latex=""}
:::{.argument data-latex=""}

Prohibiting adults from taking drugs legally has high costs: It is expensive, organized crime runs the trade, it leads to corruption in law enforcement and it undermines civil liberties.\
In spite of the War on Drugs, drugs are widely available.\

So other methods for dealing with the problems of drug use should be sought.

:::
::::

**_This provocative line_** of reasoning is certainly far from being taken seriously in any official policy making circles. But shouldn't it at least get a hearing? It seems that the premises are true. Rates of drug use and drug availability have been fairly steady for at least the last few decades, yet record numbers of Americans now sit in jail as a result of drug law violations. Other countries, such as the Netherlands, Great Britain, Germany and Canada have in recent years sought alternatives to criminalizing drug use. Might that be an option here as well? The recent proliferation of drug law reform efforts on the state level indicates that this argument is being taken more seriously in the USA as well.
