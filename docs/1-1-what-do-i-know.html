<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> What do I know?</h2>
<p>As mammals outfitted with complex nervous systems we are constantly receiving input from our senses. We perceive colors, sounds, smells, tastes and bodily sensations from the moment we wake up until the moment we fall completely asleep each day and even in sleep we are not completely shut off from sensory input. All of this raw sensation is processed behind the scenes of our conscious minds in myriad ways we are just beginning to understand, and as a result we are presented with a picture of a world of objects in space and time interacting with each other and us in many different ways. This much we share with other animals, or at least with those with whom we have a cerebral cortex in common. But unlike those other animals, our unique linguistic capacity enables us to engage with the world of our experience in a way that they cannot.</p>
<p>First of all, our ability to use and understand language enables us to explicitly categorize and classify what we experience - things are not just there in our surroundings as objects we happen to come across. Instead we both consciously and unconsciously organize the things we encounter into groups based on concepts such as: edible or inedible, animate or inanimate, threatening or safe, members of our social group or not members of our group, male or female, cause or effect, and so on. Now although there is clear evidence that certain animals do this to a limited extent as well - dogs, for example distinguish between their owners and strangers quite readily and reliably - for us, these acts of categorizing and classifying can be endlessly expanded and modified and also made fully explicit to our own awareness. We can endlessly expand our categories to include anything and everything conceivable - “80’s hair bands,” “things not good for eating in bed,” “mops,” and “former presidents,” just to give a quick random sample. Not only do we thus have an infinitely variable way of looking at the world and organizing our experience according to concepts and categories but we can see and understand how we are doing so since we can articulate this organization verbally. Hence we can recognize that we are dividing up the world in a particular way and do it in a different way. We can add new categories or modify how we use them as we notice new similarities or subtle distinctions among things. We may also revise and refine our categories as accumulated personal and shared experience reveals to us their strengths and weaknesses - whether they “carve nature at its joints” or not. This ability to look at things in new ways as a result of collectively accumulated experience is rooted in the fact that we use language to do so and language is both infinitely extensible and essentially shared with other humans. Most importantly for the story I am telling here, we can ask ourselves about the implications of the way we look at the world, and we can wonder about whether we have good reasons for looking at things as we do.</p>
<p>This is a point that it is hard to overemphasize but also easy to miss since we take it so much for granted. By asking ourselves about the reasons we have for believing that some aspect or other of our experience is true we are asking ourselves not only about the way things are, but about the way things should be; not just what we happen to believe about things based on their appearance to us, but about what we should believe about them because it reflects their true reality. And by asking ourselves such questions we are asking what philosophers call normative questions, questions that have to do with values, with concepts like right, wrong, good, bad, true, false, beautiful and ugly.</p>
