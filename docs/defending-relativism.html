<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Defending Relativism</h2>
<p><span class="newthought">Thus far</span> we have been looking at the pros and cons of accepting relativism as an approach to ethics. In doing so we have been avoiding asking a simple question, that we now cannot any longer avoid – <em>is relativism true?</em> To answer this question we need to take a look at how we might argue for relativism instead of just leaving it as one opinion among others that we might take or leave. Although it may seem obvious to many people that relativism is in fact true, our examination of the explicit case that can be made in defense of relativism will show that it is not in fact based on very good arguments. But I am getting ahead of the story…</p>
<div id="cultural-differences" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Cultural differences</h3>
<p><span class="newthought">The first</span> and most obvious way to defend relativism is based on the recognition of human cultural diversity. This was what motivated Herodotus to pronounce that “custon is the kinf of all,” and that has led many athropologists and sociologists to embrace it as well. So the first argument for relativism that we will examine here rests on recognition of the diversity of value judgments and tries to argue from this premise directly to the conclusion that there are no ultimate standards for right and wrong.</p>
<div class="argument">
<p>
We all have different views about right and wrong.<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>
Thus there are no standards about what is really right or wrong.
</p>
</div>
<p><span class="newthought">This argument</span> may seem to be persuasive. Doesn’t the fact of human diversity automatically entail relativism? But the question we should ask about this argument is not “Does it seem persuasive?”, but “Is it valid and sound?” Remember a valid argument is one in which if the premises are true the conclusion must be true. So is this valid? How can we tell? We just ask, “If the premise were true, would the conclusion also have to be true?” In this case the premise seems obviously true, but does that by itself force us to accept the conclusion? Clearly not, since even if the premise is true and we do all disagree, this alone does not have to mean that there are no standards. However implausible it may seem that there are universal moral standards, the fact of human disagreement about what those standards might look like is just not enough to rule out the existence of standards. To see this, it may help to consider a clearly bad argument of exactly the same logical form in which the premise is clearly true and the conclusion is clearly false.</p>
</div>
<div id="a-counterexample" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>A counterexample</h3>
<div class="argument">
<p>
We all have different views about how to deal with stop signs – some of come to a complete stop while others only slow down.<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>
Thus there are no standards regarding stop signs.
</p>
</div>
<p><span class="newthought">The premise</span> in this argument is clearly true as any casual observation of drivers at intersections will show. Yet the conclusion is also clearly false, since there really is a correct way to deal with stop signs, the one written in the relevant section of the laws governing driving. What this shows about the argument from cultural differences is that disagreement alone is not enough evidence for the conclusion that there are no real standards. From the fact that we may disagree about some topic we cannot conclude anything about whether or not any of us are really right or really wrong. We need much more evidence than this to support the conclusions of relativism. We disagree about many things. In some of these cases there is a way of settling disagreements – look up the law, check the facts if we disagree about the temperature outside or whether or not it is still snowing. In other cases, there is simply no way to settle differences – some people will just not be convinced that the Backstreet Boys or horrible musicians, or that sushi is the best dish on the planet. Likewise in all matters of style and taste.</p>
<p><span class="newthought">So this argument</span> for relativism is inconclusive. Relativism focuses on our differences of opinion and tries to draw from this a conclusion that just does not follow. We still are no closer to deciding whether, as in cases of dispute about the law, we will be able to settle our ethical differences, or whether, as in cases of dispute about taste, we will not. It remains an open question whether or not there are standards in ethics.</p>
</div>
<div id="learning-right-from-wrong" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>learning right from wrong</h3>
<div class="argument">
<p>
If we get our values from our cultural environments then our values are culturally determined.<br />
If values are culturally determined then they are relative to cultures.<br />
We do in fact get our values from our cultural environments.<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>
Thus relativism is true – values are relative to cultures.
</p>
</div>
<p><span class="newthought">This is</span> a valid argument, so at first it seems like the relativist position might be stronger than we have be claiming. The question then becomes whether or not it is sound. Are the premises in fact true? The key premises are the first and the third. Let us consider the first: “If we get our values from our cultural environments then our values are culturally determined.” There are two ways we might understand this statement one of which makes it true by definition and the other of which makes it just plain false. If getting our values from our cultural environments means the same thing as our values being culturally determined, then the first premise is true, but completely uninformative, since it gives us no new information. But if, on the other hand, this claim is not true by definition it is in fact false, since it just does not follow that where we get something in any way determines what that thing is. As a counterexample: just because we learn arithmetic within the particular cultural environment of modern school systems does not mean that the content of arithmetic is at all determined by this environment. 2 + 2 = 4 wherever you happen to learn this. What we learn is at least in principle independent of where we learn it.</p>
<p><span class="newthought">The third premise</span>, “We do in fact get our values from our cultural environments,” is equally suspect. It is possible that this is true, but it assumes some things about human psychological development that are simply unknown at this point in time – the extent to which the ideas that we have in our heads are products of our immediate environments, and the extent to which they are products of built in psychological capacities and functions. Well then, where would ideas about right and wrong they come from, if not from the environment in which a person is raised? One possibility is that human moral development is somewhat built in, that we are all born with the capacity for social interaction and that this gets switched on, in a sense, as we grow and interact with others. If this view were correct we would expect to find that the variation of moral ideas among is humans is less pronounced than relativism claims. And in fact, if we ignore the surface differences between human value systems and look at the core values people accept, they start to look very similar.</p>
<p><span class="newthought">In fact</span> we could take this point further and point out that all human cultures share certain basic values. We all:</p>
<ul>
<li>honor the dead with some sort of funeral rites and find it incredibly offensive to mistreat the dead.</li>
<li>act so as to help the group to survive.</li>
<li>believe in the importance of telling the truth in general, even if exceptions are sometimes made to this.
distinguish between acceptable and wrongful killing of other human beings.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="newthought">This possibility</span> that there is a common moral ground between groups of people is tempting as a possible alternative to relativism. What relativism gets right is the fact that we all disagree about how to carry out the basic moral demands these core values impose on us. But what it gets wrong is the degree to which we do all disagree. After all, we all have some way of honoring the dead, we all think that the survival of our group is important, we all recognize that communication is only possible against a general background of truth-telling, and we all agree that there is something that should be considered the wrongful killing of a human being or murder, even if different cultures have very different ways of putting these values into practice.</p>
<p><span class="newthought">But then</span>, wait a moment, doesn’t relativism just reappear on another level? So what if we all agree on the importance of honoring the dead? Our different views about how exactly to do this have the potential to lead to serious conflict. And it is far from clear that this kind of conflict, conflict about the implementation of core values, can really be resolved.</p>
<p><span class="newthought">In response</span> to this problem let us take a closer look at what I claimed above was one of the common core values all human cultures share, the distinction we all make between acceptable and wrongful homicide. The relativist might argue that the fact that we all agree that there is such a distinction in all societies does nothing to alleviate the conflicts between societies. Take the way in which this value was put into practice in Nazi Germany: it was considered wrong to kill a member of the “Aryan” race, but acceptable and even necessary to kill Jews, Slavic people and Gypsies (among others). We, on the other hand, fought against Germany in WWII because, among other reasons, we disagreed that this was a legitimate way to make the distinction between acceptable and wrongful homicide. Our beliefs are that it is only acceptable to kill others in self-defense, in a just war or, in some cases, as a penalty for very serious crimes. Is there any way to resolve this conflict, or does relativism gain back all of the ground it has lost in the preceding discussion?</p>
<p><span class="newthought">Well</span>, once we recognize that the Nazis are not living in a completely foreign moral universe, that they share with us the basic idea that there is an important moral distinction between justified and unjustified homicide, we can take a critical look at their way of making this distinction. And in fact it is quickly apparent that they made this distinction in a faulty way – based on pseudo-scientific theories of race, based on the political manipulation of people’s fears and based on paranoia. Hence, even on their own terms, the way in which they made this important distinction fails to be satisfactory. It is the fact that we share this basic distinction with them that enables us to criticize their way of putting in into practice. We can always ask of a given cultural practice or value, whether it is based on claims that stand up to scrutiny and whether it performs as advertised. This sort of internal criticism is only possible on the basis of shared human concerns that transcend different cultures.</p>
