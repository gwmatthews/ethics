In theory there is no difference between theory and practice, but in practice there is.\

**_At this point_** we have explored many different approaches to the fundamental questions of philosophical ethics. We have examined how they account for and justify basic moral principles and we have looked at how well-founded each of them was as a philosophical theory. But given such an abundance of approaches you may be left wondering about how this might play out in the real world. Do we just pick whichever theory we like or which leads us to the results we want and then claim justification? Or, as the storyline of this book implies, if the last of our approaches comes closest to the truth about ethics, are we then just left to try to implement the very general principles of morality in the less than ideal real world? In a sense well be taking both of these approaches in our discussion of applied ethics in the next part of the book. We'll first examine how we might approach the implementation of the basic, and still pretty formal and general, moral principles that lie at the heart of moral thinking in Kant's view. And we'll do this by looking at three different approaches to the implementation of moral rules, virtue ethics, feminist ethics and Buddhist ethics in the Japanese Zen tradition. These may seem like radically different approaches, and yet they all have in common the question -- how might we put principles into practice?

**_Then in the succeeding chapters_** we will look briefly at a number of topics in applied ethics in the light of the various theories we have been examining. It turns out that under the surface of many debates in applied ethics there are competing ethical theories and commitments. What makes these debates debates about ethics, and not policy debates about the pros and cons of some topic or other is that both sides appeal to something that seems like it has a legitimate moral claim to our allegiance. 

## Virtue ethics reconsidered

**_We first encountered virtue ethics_** in the context of our discussion of Natural Law Theory, although its roots go much further back historically than the work of Thomas Aquinas whose ideas we focused on there. They go back especialy to the work of Aristotle. For Aristotle humans are not only "rational animals" but perhaps even more crucially "political animals." We live together in society and it is only in the context of our social relations that it makes any sense at all to speak of ethics. Unlike relativists, though, Aristotle doesn't take this to mean that society *defines* right and wrong by taking ultimately arbitrary cultural norms and elevating them to the status of moral principles. What he means has more to do with understanding what it is to be a "good person" in  the sense of one who exhibits good judgment and what he calls "practical wisdom." A good, or "virtuous" person^[Aristotle uses the word "*arete*" which is often translated as "virtue" but this is an imperfect translation. Perhaps a better way to translate "*arete*" is with "excellence" or "skill" not in the sense of technical ability, but in the sense of having cultivated to a high degree the "softer" skills of good judgment, self-control and mastery of one's own life.] is someone who is good at making "judgment calls" or at finding his or her way through difficult decisions with poise and balance.
