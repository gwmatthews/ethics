In theory there is no difference between theory and practice, but in practice there is.\

**_At this point_** we have explored many different approaches to the fundamental questions of philsophical ethics. We have examined how they account for and justify basic moral principles and we have looked at how well-founded each of them was as a philosophical theory. But given such an abundance of approaches you may be left wondering about how this might play out in the real world. Do we just pick whichever theory we like or which leads us to the results we want and then claim justification? Or, as the trajectory of this book implies, is the last of our approaches basically correct and then up to us to try to implement in our lives? In a sense well be taking both of these approaches in our discussion of applied ethics in the next part of the book. We'll first examine how we might approach the implementation of the basic, and still pretty formal and general, moral principles that lie at the heart of moral thinking in Kant's view. And we'll do this by looking at three different approaches to the implementation of moral rules, virtue ethics, feminist ethics and Buddhist ethics in the Japanese Zen tradition. These may seem like radically different approaches, and yet they all have in common the question -- how might we put principles into practice?

Then in the succeeding chapters we will look breifly at a number of topics in applied ethics in the light of the various theories we have been examining. It turns out that under the surface of many debates in applied ethics there are competing ethical theories and commitments.

## Virtue ethics reconsidered

## Feminism, gender and ethics

## Zen practice -- realizing ethics
