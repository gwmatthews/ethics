In theory there is no difference between theory and practice, but in practice there is.\

**_At this point_** we have explored many different approaches to the fundamental questions of philosophical ethics. We have examined how they account for and justify basic moral principles and we have looked at how well-founded each of them was as a philosophical theory. But given such an abundance of approaches you may be left wondering about how this might play out in the real world. Do we just pick whichever theory we like or which leads us to the results we want and then claim justification? Or, as the storyline of this book implies, if the last of our approaches comes closest to the truth about ethics, are we then just left to try to implement the very general principles of morality in the less than ideal real world? In a sense we will be relying on both of these strategies in our discussion of applied ethics in this part of the book. We'll first examine how we might go about implementating the basic, but still formal and general moral principles that lie at the heart of moral thinking in Kant's view. And we'll do this by looking at three different approaches to the implementation of moral rules: contemporary reflections on the relation of ethical principles to the communities we live in, feminist discussions of ethics and gender, and Buddhist ethics in the Japanese Zen tradition. These may seem like radically different approaches, and yet they all have in common the question -- how might we put principles into practice in the real world. This choice of topics is not intended to be comprehensive as there are many more ways of looking at the implementation of ethical principles than these three. But these all strike me as important, and worthy of discussion here since all raise important issues about what ethics looks like in the real world. These are all somewhat personal reflections on topics of interest to me and of current relevance.

**_Then in the succeeding chapters_** we will look at a number of topics in applied ethics in the light of the various theories we have been examining. It turns out that under the surface of many debates in applied ethics there are competing ethical theories and commitments. What makes these debates debates about ethics, and not policy debates about the pros and cons of some topic or other, is that both sides appeal to something that seems like it has a legitimate moral claim to our allegiance. In many cases the major arguments can be roughly divided between those that follow utilitarian ideas and those that appeal to Kantian ethical ideals and principles, but that is not always the case and the particularities of each topic often present obstacles to this simple dichtomy. We'll see how the different debates we have already examined on a purely theoretical basis play out for each topic.

**_So let us the turn first_** to reflect on how we might look at the issue of implementing ethical principles. After this we will examine the topics of euthanasia; indiviudal liberty and the legality of recreational drugs; crime and punishment; ethics and non-human animals; and environmental ethics. Each of these are huge topics and we will only be able to give a bare outline of some of the major ethical issues and argumentative strategies employed by backers of different sides of each issue. The point here is to provide a brief overview of what I take to be the major lines of argument availble for elaboration in each case. It is my hope that this will be an inspiration for further exploration of these topics. So, then, let's jump right in!

## Ethics in community

::: {.epigraph data-latex=""}

Debates about justice and rights are often, unavoidably, debates about the purpose of social institutions, the goods they allocate, and the virtues they honor and reward. Despite our best attempts to make law neutral on such questions, it may not be possible to say whatâ€™s just without arguing about the nature of the good life.\
