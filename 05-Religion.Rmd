**According to divine command theory**

- Moral principles tell us what we *should* do.
- Commands are meaningless without authority to back them up.
- The universal scope of moral commands requires divine backing.

:::{.rmdcaution data-latex="" .infobox}
**The dilemma of divine command theory**

- Is something wrong **because God says so**?
  - This would make morality *arbitrary*.
- Or does God say something is wrong because **it really is wrong**?
  - This would make morality *independent* of God'd will.

- Understanding things requires understanding their purpose.
- Human nature is clearly visible by the "light of reason."
- It is better to follow the natural order of things than to oppose it.
